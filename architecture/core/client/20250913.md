# Direct method calls and message passing

To have (in)direct method calls, we can have a shared WASM Table which allows us to have references to methods of plugins in one single memory block, then we can execute them given its index.
"Plugins should share a WASM Table, this way, we can have (in)direct method calls across plugins"

To be able to pass any data across plugins, with zero-copy code, we can use a shared Vec<u8> memory, which means, one Memory instance will be used for all the plugins, and they will pass data as ptr: i32, len: i32

"Plugins should share a Vec<u8> linear memory, this way, one SideEffect plugin can access a Core Event throught ptr: i32, len: i32 and parse it as Message<const N: usize> for events, and as whatever else they want when parsing messages from ptr: i32, len: i32"

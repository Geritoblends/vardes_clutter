# Mental Clutter Repository

This repository was created because I figured out that it's really hard for me to keep up progressing once I stop.
The initial idea was to make one github commit daily, but lately, it's been increasingly hard because I often find myself in the pressure of having to commit something the same day I'm barely starting to understand what the system needs, and even worse, those needs are commonly Rust topics I have no idea of. I often end up simply commiting linux dotfiles or Claude code I barely understand the architecture of. 
I think that the "daily commit" approach is perfect because it mantains my brain thinking in the project every day, even if the code I write is just some dozens of lines, however, for days like these, I think that uploading the concepts I've thought of throughout the day as a properly written markdown file is a better approach, and that's where this repo comes handy. It's like a "Streak Freeze", like the dotfiles commits, but these ones atleast mean I did thought out about the project.

Of course tho, this repository should be used as Streak Freezes rather than consecutively.
